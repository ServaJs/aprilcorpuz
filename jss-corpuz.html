    <b>TOPIC</b>: Is Animal Testing Morally Justifiable?
   <br>
   <b>POSITION:</b></b> <b>NO: Mahatma Gandhi,</b> <i>"The greatness of a nation and its moral     
                          progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."</i>
                          <br>
<b>ISSUE SUMMARY</b>   : Animal testing is not morally justifiable, animals are not created for
       human's benefits, Mahatma Gandhi said that the morale of a country
                          is based on how they treat animals because animals have own      
                          feelings and lives too, similar to human, so killing is not moral even if it's  
                          animals. Animals also deserve respect and a treatment they deserve,      
                          so the animal testing is unnecessary and should have been eliminated.                          
</p>

    Many believe animals are inferior to humans, leading to instances of animal abuse. human and animals body, tissues, and skin are different, hence results from animals cannot be applied to humans. Morally, this is unjustifiable as animals have their own lives. Animals suffering from pain due to the tests that lead to skin and eye irritation conducted without pain relief or anesthesia by rubbing chemicals on their shaved skin or dripping them into their eyes. Animal testing should be illegal because of inhumane, cruel, and against animals' intrinsic rights. Animal testing, prevalent in cosmetics and medicine, involves assessing products for toxicity and side effects. These tests are deemed cruel due to the harm inflicted on animals. Using animals for testing is ethically questionable due to the inhumane processes involved and it's not guaranteed that the effects of a product or medicine that test on animals is the same effect when applied on humans.

</p>
<p id="indent">
    Animal testing is not morally justifiable, even though they are animals, we humans have don't rights to take away their lives. Animals are more like a companion, a friend, a family, killing is not actually moral, if it is animal or any other life it is not moral to take the life of others, we humans don't actually have the rights to kill them, we should respect other life on our planets because they have feelings, consciousness, and thoughts, animals are not created for humans selfishness.

       Animal testing is an unnecessary practice, subjecting innocent animals to experiments raises serious moral concerns, animals can experience pain and distress like humans during the process or experiment. There are other alternative methods, such as in vitro testing and advanced computer simulations, is not only more humane but also scientifically more reliable results without causing any harm to animals. Using animals for research or testing products is not right. We should explore and embrace alternative ways that care about all living beings.

    Cosmetic industry is one the most animal testing practises, they test beauty products to animals if it's safe to human. Animals such as rabbits, dogs, rodents, or others are used in the testing of skincare, makeup, and hygiene products. <i>The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated</i> (Mahatma Gandhi). It is said that you will see a nation morale by how they treat animals, animal testing have threats to our environment because it pollutes water, air, and ground soil. Animal testing result to environmental waste and toxic chemical, the disposal process of animal testing causes exposure to biohazards and radioactive materials.

    Animals experiment does not actually mimic how the human body and human disease responds to medicine. There are many types of diseases that came from animals like zonotic disease, it's a bacteria that came from animals that can be transmitted to humans. Animals have lives, consciousness and they have feelings, animals that subjected to animal testing can have stress, discomfort, and even death to animals , the animals that have been tested suffer from various health problems such as loss of appetite, pain, hair loss, apathy, and other problems (Radi, 2023). Animals doesn't get many disease unlike humans such as Parkinson's disease, major types of heart disease, many types of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, HIV or schizophrenia.

    Animal rights are violated when they are subjected to a research, according to Tom Regan, a philosophy professor at North Carolina State University, states: <i>"Animals have a basic moral right to respectful treatment".</i> Animals also deserves respect, it's is a disrespect to animals when they are use to experiments and lab activity because researcher or scientist treats animals as a mere tools for them to test and experiment something that they believe will be the future of science or biology (Orlan, 1993). Regan further says, that <i>"animal [experimentation] is morally wrong no matter how much humans may benefit because the animal's basic right has been infringed". "Risks are not morally transferable to those who do not choose to take them"</i> (Orlan, 
1993).

    Humans and animals are almost the same, animals can feel pain too just like human do, animals and humans reaction to pain are similar, they also screams in pain. When animals are used for product toxicity testing or laboratory research, they are subjected to painful and frequently deadly experiments. Two of the most commonly used toxicity tests are the Draize test and the LD50 test, both of which are known for the intense pain and suffering they cause upon experimental animals. In the Draize test the substance or product are being tested in animal eye which commonly subjected to rabbit. Then the animal is monitored for damage to the cornea and other tissues in and near the eye. This test is intensely painful for the animal, and blindness, scarring, and death are generally the end results.
</p>
<p id="indent">
     Draize test has been criticized for being unreliable because it doesn't produces much results and just waste the life of an animal. The LD50 test is used to test the dosage of a substance that is necessary to cause death in fifty percent of the animal subjects within a certain amount of time. To perform this test, the researchers hook the animals up to tubes that pump huge amounts of the test product into their stomachs until they die. In his article entitled "Time to Reform Toxic Tests," (Michael Balls,1992) a professor of medial cell biology at the University of Nottingham and chairman of the trustees of FRAME (the Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments), states that the LD50 test is <i>"scientifically unjustifiable".</i>

        The testing of products on animals is completely unnecessary because there are alternatives are available. Many Cosmetic company reduce to use animals to test their products instead they use an alternative like synthetic materials, because synthetic materials behave like a skin tissue of human. In Against Animal Testing, a pamphlet published by The Body Shop, a well-known cosmetics and bath-product company based in London, the development of products that "use natural ingredients, like bananas and Basil nut oil, as well as others with a long history of safe human usage" is advocated instead of testing on animals. Another alternative to this test is a product called Eyetex. This synthetic material turns opaque when a product damages it, closely resembling the way that a real eye reacts to harmful substances. 
</p>
<p id="indent">
         Computers are also been used to simulate and estimate the potential damage that a product or chemical can cause, and human tissues and cells have been used to examine the effects of harmful substances. In another method, in vitro testing, cellular tests are done inside a test tube. All of these tests have been proven to be useful and reliable alternatives to testing products on live animals. Therefore, because there are many alternative to without the use of live animal specimens, testing potentially deadly substances on animals is unnecessary.
</p>
<p id="indent">
    In conclusion, animal testing should be eliminated because it violates animals right, in a toxicity testing or experiment on subjected animals, most of the research or experiment doesn't produce result, leading to a waste on the lives of animal, and other means of testing product toxicity are available. Humans cannot justify making life better for themselves by torturing animals for humans safety. Animals should be treated with respect and dignity, it is a disrespect to animals because they have feeling, they can feel pain, so they should not experience such things for the safety of selfish humans. After all, humans are animals too.
