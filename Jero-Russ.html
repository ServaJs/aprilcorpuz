                          <br>
<b>ISSUE SUMMARY</b>   : Some of people think that abortion is normal and legal because they think it's.not a human and they even think it’s not alive because it's only a fetus,but
                          little they know that fetus is a form of life, once fetus is form it's already alive, 
                          abotion is immoral because a fetus not at fault, so why kill them, they are,
                                innocent and they have rights to live

          The topic of whether abortion is immoral is a complex and contentious ethical
 debate. People's perspectives on this issue often hinge on their moral, religious, or philosophical beliefs. Proponents of the view that abortion is immoral often argue from a standpoint that values the sanctity of life, asserting that the fetus has inherent moral worth and a right to life. On the other hand, those who support a woman's right to choose may emphasize autonomy and reproductive rights. The debate involves a nuanced exploration of ethics, rights, and the status of the unborn.Why abortion immoral?The first important question to consider is:what is killed in an abortion? It is obvious that some living entity is killed in an abortion. A fetus may does not have a necessary traits of personhood but abortion is seriously immoral, that it is in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being.

     Rochelle N Shain (1986) Abortion is a universal phenomenon, occurring throughout recorded history and at all levels of societal organization. Techniques are highly varied, as are the circumstances under which it is practised. The status of and attitudes towards abortion in Western civilization are variable and have, in most cases, been changing. As of 1982, 10% and 18% of the world’s population respectively, lived in countries where abortion was totally prohibited or where it was permitted only to save the mother’s life. In the USA, various national surveys indicate liberalization of public attitudes towards pregnancy termination between 1965 and the years immediately following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision (1973) which legalized abortion. More recent polls demonstrate little attitudinal change since 1972–1973: between 80% and 90% of Americans approve of abortion in the case of poor health, a seriously defective fetus, or rape, and between 40% and 50% indicate approval for all other reasons as well. Only 10% of the American population would like to see abortion prohibited under all circumstances. Sociodemographic analyses indicate that individuals who disapprove of abortion differ from those who approve of its availability in that they are more likely to be Roman Catholic or fundamentalist Protestant; are, in general, more strongly committed to organized religion; are on the traditional/conservative end of the spectrum with regard to women’s role in life, premarital sex, sex education and civil liberties; and tend to have achieved a relatively low educational level. ‘Pro-life’ and ‘pro-choice’ activists tend to be women who are completely different from one another in sociodemographic characteristics and in overall values, particularly as these relate to traditional versus modern female roles.

Donald Marquis argues that killing actual persons is wrong because it unjustly deprives victims of their future; that the fetus has a future similar in morally relevant respects to the future lost by competent adult homicide victims, and that, as consequence, abortion is justifiable only in the same circumstances in which killing competent adult human beings is justifiable. Don marquis (2007), Another reason for making these exceptions is to allow for those cases in which the permissibility of abortion is compatible with the argument of this essay. Such cases include abortion when continuation of a pregnancy endangers a woman’s life and abortion when the fetus is a ltimately, respectful dialogue and understanding diverse perspectives are crucial in shaping effective solutions.nencephalic. When I speak of the wrongness of abortion in this essay, a reader should presume the above qualifications.

              Ruth colker (1988) In addition, people who consider abortion to be moral can respect the value of prenatal life. Of course, not all people who take a pro-life position respect the well-being of women and not all people who take a pro-choice position respect the value of prenatal life. Yet there are enough people who make respectful pro-life and pro-choice arguments that I think we must conclude that it can be an area of good faith disagreement. About abortion immoral is okay because not all women want to get pregnant and maybe they don't have enough money to raise the child, so they abort the baby.There is also a reason for abortion because the parents don't want it or the man doesn't want it, so there is a big chance to abort it.

   The topic of abortion is complex and often involves ethical, moral, and legal considerations. Fostering a supportive environment for individuals facing unplanned pregnancies can contribute to reducing the need for abortions. It's important to engage in open and respectful dialogue to understand various viewpoints and work towards solutions that consider the well-being of all involved.
