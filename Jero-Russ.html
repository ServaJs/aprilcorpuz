The topic of whether abortion is immoral is a complex and contentious ethical debate. People's perspectives on this issue often hinge on their moral, religious, or philosophical beliefs. Proponents of the view that abortion is immoral often argue from a standpoint that values the sanctity of life, asserting that the fetus has inherent moral worth and a right to life. On the other hand, those who support a woman's right to choose may emphasize autonomy and reproductive rights. The debate involves a nuanced exploration of ethics, rights, and the status of the unborn.Why abortion immoral?The first important question to consider is:what is killed in an abortion? It is obvious that some living entity is killed in an abortion.A fetus may does not have a necessary traits of personhood but abortion is seriously immoral, that it is in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being.

 Forty percent of the world's population now lives in countries where induced abortion is permitted on request, and 25 percent lives where it is allowed only if the woman's life is in danger. In 1987, an estimated 26 to 31 million legal abortions and 10 to 22 million clandestine abortions were performed worldwide. Legal abortion rates ranged from a high of at least 112 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the Soviet Union to a low of five per 1,000 in the Netherlands. In recent years, abortion rates   have been increasing in Czechoslovakia, England and Wales, New Zealand and Sweden and declining in China, France, Iceland, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. In most Western European and English-speaking countries, about half of abortions are obtained by young, unmarried women seeking to delay a first birth, while in Eastern Europe and the developing countries, abortion is most common among married women with two or more children. Mortality from legal abortion averages 0.6 deaths per 100,000 procedures in developed countries with data. Abortion services are increasingly being provided outside of hospitals, and for those performed in hospitals, overnight stays are becoming less common. National health insurance covers abortions needed to preserve the health of a pregnant woman in all developed countries except the United States, where Medicaid and federal insurance programs do not cover abortion unless the woman's life is in danger.

The idea that abortion is immoral has deep historical and cultural roots, intertwined with various religious, philosophical, and ethical traditions. In many religious contexts, doctrines emphasize the sanctity of life, viewing it as a divine gift. This perspective contributes to the belief that intentionally terminating a pregnancy is morally objectionable. Philosophical arguments often revolve around questions of personhood, rights, and the moral status of the unborn.

              Over time, societies have grappled with defining the beginning of life and the moral implications of abortion. Legal and cultural attitudes toward abortion have evolved, reflecting broader shifts in societal values. Debates surrounding abortion morality continue to be complex, reflecting a range of perspectives on the inherent worth of human life and the ethical responsibilities associated with reproduction.

              Donald Marquis argues that killing actual persons is wrong because it unjustly deprives victims of their future; that the fetus has a future similar in morally relevant respects to the future lost by competent adult homicide victims, and that, as consequence, abortion is justifiable only in the same circumstances in which killing competent adult human beings is justifiable.

          Don marquis (2007), Another reason for making these exceptions is to allow for those cases in which the permissibility of abortion is compatible with the argument of this essay. Such cases include abortion when continuation of a pregnancy endangers a woman’s life and abortion when the fetus is a ltimately, respectful dialogue and understanding diverse perspectives are crucial in shaping effective solutions.nencephalic. When I speak of the wrongness of abortion in this essay, a reader should presume the above qualifications.

             Ruth colker (1988) In addition, people who consider abortion to be moral can respect the value of prenatal life. Of course, not all people who take a pro-life position respect the well-being of women and not all people who take a pro-choice position respect the value of prenatal life. Yet there are enough people who make respectful pro-life and pro-choice arguments that I think we must conclude that it can be an area of good faith disagreement.

About abortion immoral is okay because not all women want to get pregnant and maybe they don't have enough money to raise the child, so they abort the baby.There is also a reason for abortion because the parents don't want it or the man doesn't want it, so there is a big chance to abort it.

The topic of abortion is complex and often involves ethical, moral, and legal considerations. Fostering a supportive environment for individuals facing unplanned pregnancies can contribute to reducing the need for abortions. It's important to engage in open and respectful dialogue to understand various viewpoints and work towards solutions that consider the well-being of all involved.
